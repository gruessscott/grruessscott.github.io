title: Learning German - The Gender of Nouns
category: german
---

For native English speakers, learning languages where the gender of the
nouns is important for the grammar, like in German, can be daunting. Why
is it "die Sonne", but "der Mond"? They're both objects up in the sky that
are bright, right? In this article, I explain the trick that I learned
based on an idea my wife had when I first started German.

## Being sexist

When learning vocabulary words, there's no getting around memorizing the
articles with their nouns, but using a pattern or a story can really
help. And since we're talking about gender, being blatantly sexist can
help create the silly stories that will keep those genders in your head.

The basic rules for the silly game for learning the gender of nouns are:

Things that are _soft_, _caring_, _comforting_, _warming_, _clean_ or _light_
are **feminine**.

Things that are _dirty_, _dark_ or _rough_ are **masculine**.

Everything else, including many German words borrowed from French and English,
is **neutral**.

## Die Decke, der Boden, das Wasser

When learning vocabulary words, use the above rules to think of a story for
each noun. Here are some examples:

_Die Decke_ [blanket; ceiling]: Blankets provide warmth and comfort, while
the ceiling provides shelter. Along the same lines, "die Wand" [wall] also
provides shelter, so these all must be **feminine**.

_Der Boden_ [floor], "der Fuss" [foot] and "der Schuh" [shoe]: These are all
dusty, dirty and stinky, so they must be **masculine**.

_Das Wasser_ [water]: Since water it has no taste or color itself, it must
be **neutral**.

_Das Restaurant_ [restaurant]: This word is borrowed from French, and these
foreign words are _often_ **neutral**.
But note that not all foriegn words are neutral--some pick up
feminine/masculine on their way into the German language, like _der Computer_.

## If the shoe doesn't fit...

Of course, there are cases where the above rules don't seem to fit.
_Die Sonne_ [Sun] and _der Mond_ [Moon] are both big round objects far
away in the sky over us that shine brightly, so shouldn't they both be
feminine? Since we know that "der Mond" is
masculine in German, coming up with a silly story that fits will make
it even easier to remember the genders. For example: _Die Sonne_ is
feminine because it is bright and provides us warmth. _Der Mond_ is also
sometimes bright, but only when the (feminine) Sun shines on it. The rest of the
time it just sits there in the dark, all cold and dusty, so it must be
masculine.

A more challenging case is silverware: _die Gabel_ [fork],
_der LÃ¶ffel_ [spoon] and _das Messer_ [knife]. For these you need to think
in abstract shapes. If you stand the fork up on its tines, the outline
resembles a _dress_ or _skirt_ fanning out at the waist, so it's feminine.
For the spoon, think of a big, fat _beer belly_, which is masculine. And
since there's nothing real special about the shape of the knife, it must be neutral.

## Conclusion: A gender you'll never forget

So as you go through your lists of new vocabulary words, thinking up little 
stories will help with remembering the gender of the words. And if it doesn't
fit at first (like the example with the moon), just add some silliness
and it will create a story (and gender) that you'll never forget.
